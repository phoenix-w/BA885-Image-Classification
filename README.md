## BA885: Image Classification Project

### Project Summary
In April 2021, the UK government began regulation of self-driving cars on certain public motorways, with the potential of allowing the use of autonomous vehicles by the end of the year. In recent years, self-driving cars have become a contentious symbol of technological progress with its potential of revolutionizing the transportation industry. One of the underlying technological components of self-driving cars is computer vision – a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs. This project aims to delve into the field of computer vision, using neural networks to create models that are able to detect and classify objects in digital images.

### Data Source
Our dataset was initially published by Intel on [Analytics Vidhya](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-intel-scene-classification-challe/#LeaderBoard) for an image classification challenge. Though the competition has ended, we were able to retrieve the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification). It contains over 17,000 labeled images, evenly spread across 6 types of sceneries – building, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street – from around the world. Each data point is a 150x150 pixels colored JPG image.
